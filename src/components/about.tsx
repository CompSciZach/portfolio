            Hi! My name is Zachary Dube. I'm a passionate software developer who loves creating and problem-solving.
            I'm currently studying computer science at John Abbott College in my third and final year.

            Recently, I've been working at Université de Montréal as a software developer. (Developing creative learning solutions for students and professors)   

            I love learning new skills & technologies, but my current focus is on machine learning & discovering the emerging field of web3.
