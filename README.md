# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my software development projects, skills, and contact information.  
The site is built using **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite.js** for a fast and modern development experience.  
Created in 2025 as part of my journey into software development.

The site features responsive design, smooth animations, and lightweight performance thanks to Vite's fast bundling.
